## Description

Tap Room is an application that allows a user to view a list of beer inventory and add new beer to the list. Updated on 09/14/2018.

## Setup

* Git clone the folder
* Run 'npm install' in terminal
* Run 'npm run start'

## Specification

* As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and alcohol content.

* As an employee, I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to add it to the list.

* As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg.

* As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.

* As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them.

* As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability on beers less than $5 per pint.

* As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.
